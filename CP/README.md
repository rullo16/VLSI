## Introduction

The CP project aims to solve instances of the circuit placement problem using MiniZinc. The problem involves placing a set of circuits on a plate with specified dimensions while satisfying certain constraints.

The project includes the following components:
- MiniZinc model files for the circuit placement problem.
- Python scripts to execute the model and solve instances.
- Instances folder containing input instances in DZN format.
- Output folder to store the solutions generated by the solver.

## Requirements

To run the CP project, you need to have the following installed on your system:
- MiniZinc solver and MiniZinc command-line tools.
- Python 3.x.

## Usage

### Execute All Instances

To execute all instances and generate solutions for the circuit placement problem, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the "CP/src" directory:

```console
cd CP/src
```

1. Run the "Solve_CP.py" script with the required arguments:

```console
python Solve_CP.py -s <solver_name> -i <instances_folder> -o <output_folder> -r <for rotation>

```
* Replace <solver_name> with either GEOCODE or CHUFFED.
* Replace <instances_folder> with the path to the folder containing the instances.
* Replace <output_folder> with the path to the folder where the output solutions will be saved.
* -r :Use this flag to enable model rotation (optional).
